        <h1>Teachable Machine Image Model For Traffic Signs</h1>
        <p>This is a p5.js sketch using a pre-trained image classification model to differentiate between stop signs, do not enter signs, and yield signs. The three classes were chosen as they pose a problem for many due to being red. At a glance, drivers may mistake them for each other if not paying attention or driving too fast to see clearly.</p>
